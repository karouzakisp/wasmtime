1) Line:498 self.value_users[arg].insert() costs too much
2) inst_arg_already_visited too expensive change data structure
3) heapz check allocators
4) clones are little costly
5) line:620 all(value.to_elab.get()) little costly;
6) line:704 clone value users? maybe think a faster way
7) value users remove costly, look hashset details
8) Check value_users if it is empty after each block. Have we removed all the instructions for each value?
